We implement our framework in a tool called CRAFT and evaluate it on a novel fixpoint-based neural network architecture (monDEQ) that is particularly challenging to verify. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that CRAFT exceeds the state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed (two orders of magnitude), scalability (one order of magnitude), and precision (25% higher certified accuracies).
