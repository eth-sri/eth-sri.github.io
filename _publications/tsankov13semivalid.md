We define semi-valid input coverage (SVCov), the first cov- erage criterion for fuzz testing. Our criterion is applicable whenever the valid inputs can be defined by a finite set of constraints. SVCov measures to what extent the tests cover the domain of semi-valid inputs, where an input is semi-valid if and only if it satisfies all the constraints but one.

We demonstrate SVCovâ€™s practical value in a case study on fuzz testing the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE). Our study shows that it is feasible to precisely define and efficiently measure SVCov. Moreover, SVCov provides es- sential information for improving the effectiveness of fuzz testing and enhancing fuzz-testing tools and libraries. In particular, by increasing coverage under SVCov, we have discovered a previously unknown vulnerability in a mature IKE implementation.
