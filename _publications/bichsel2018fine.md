Probabilistic programming is an emerging technique for modeling processes involving uncertainty. Thus, it is important to ensure these programs are assigned precise formal semantics that also cleanly handle typical exceptions such as non-termination or division by zero. However, existing semantics of probabilistic programs do not fully accommodate different exceptions and their interaction, often ignoring some or conflating multiple ones into a single exception state, making it impossible to distinguish exceptions or to study their interaction.
