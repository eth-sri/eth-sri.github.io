There are many algorithms for concurrent garbage collection, but they are complex to describe, verify, and implement. This has resulted in a poor understanding of the relationships between the algorithms, and has precluded systematic study and comparative evaluation. We present a single high-level, abstract concurrent garbage collection algorithm, and show how existing snapshot and incremental update collectors, can be derived from the abstract algorithm by reducing precision. We also derive a new hybrid algorithm that reduces floating garbage while terminating quickly. We have implemented a concurrent collector framework and the resulting algorithms in IBMâ€™s J9 Java virtual machine product and compared their performance in terms of space, time, and incrementality. The results show that incremental update algorithms sometimes reduce memory requirements (on 3 of 5 benchmarks) but they also sometimes take longer due to recomputation in the termination phase (on 4 of 5 benchmarks). Our new hybrid algorithm has memory requirements similar to the incremental update collectors while avoiding recomputation in the termination phase.
