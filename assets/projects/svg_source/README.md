Vectorization
-------------

Copy the png into inkscape. Trace the paths, adapting curves as required. Hide the png and copy into `svg_source`. Leave the image inside the SVG to aid future adaptation.

Then install scour (https://github.com/nielstron/scour) and run `optimize.sh` to create optimized svgs. This removes the PNG and performs other auto-optimizations.
