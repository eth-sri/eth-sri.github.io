title: Tests for RMA networks

<p>Each archive contains the *.c file we used to run on Cray Aries, the *.sbatch file used to launch the test on the machine, the *.out file as the output and the *.err file which records if assertions were violated while running the test.</p>

<p>The tests are grouped by pivot rule:

 <a href="rma_tests/R1.tar.gz">R1</a>,

 <a href="rma_tests/R2.tar.gz">R2</a>, 

 <a href="rma_tests/IR.tar.gz">IR</a>, 

 <a href="rma_tests/F2.tar.gz">F2</a>. </p>

<p>Check using Alloy if assertions on RMA programs:</br>
