<h2>Virtual Machine with DPS preinstalled</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Note: we tested the Virtual Machine, by giving it 14GB of RAM. Make sure your host machine has 16GB or more.</li>
  <li>Download the virtual machine image from <a href="dps/DPSBox.tar.bz2">here</a></li>
  <li>Untar it and run it in VirtualBox.</li>
  <li>Login
    <ul>
      <li>User: dps</li>
      <li>Password: DPSpassword</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>The tool is in a subdirectory dps of the home directory. Run "cd dps".</li>
  <li>Run ./build.sh</li>
  <li>The output files are out_JGF*.txt 
    <ul>
      <li>To see the number of determinizations, you can run "grep models *.txt".</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Optional: if you want to only run some benchmarks, you can edit build.sh in the dps/ directory.
    <ul>
      <li>The variable BENCHMARKS contains a list of benchmarks to run on (keep in mind that Crypt requires 12GB of RAM).</li>
      <li>The variable OPTIONS determines the type of synthesis:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>tsc_trans2 - this generates the most fine-grained constraints by not requiring an ordering specification, or</li>
        <li>rw_avoidconflict_tsc_trans2 - this includes the specification where reads go after write on a variable (unless this creates a confict).</li>
      </ul>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
