    We design PRIMA, a precise and scalable neural network verifier, which can
    handle different activation functions, realistic network architectures and
    relevant specifications. PRIMA computes precise convex abstractions involving
    multiple neurons via novel convex hull approximation algorithms that leverage
    concepts from computational geometry.
excerpt: By leveraging tight multi-neuron constraints we can boost the certified robustness of networks.

### Content

We design PRIMA, a precise and scalable neural network verifier, which can
handle different activation functions, realistic network architectures and
relevant specifications. PRIMA computes precise convex abstractions involving
multiple neurons via novel convex hull approximation algorithms that leverage
concepts from computational geometry.

Now let's go into more details.

More stuff.
