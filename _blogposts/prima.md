We design PRIMA, a precise and scalable neural network verifier, which can
handle different activation functions, realistic network architectures and
relevant specifications. PRIMA computes precise convex abstractions involving
multiple neurons via novel convex hull approximation algorithms that leverage
concepts from computational geometry.

Now let's go into more details.

More stuff.
