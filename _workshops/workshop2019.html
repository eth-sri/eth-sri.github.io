<h2>Workshop Information</h2>
Ensuring that our programs behave correctly and reliably is a fundamental challenge facing computing today. Recent years have seen an explosion of a diverse set of new techniques for ensuring program correctness ranging from verification and synthesis approaches to runtime systems to quantitative reasoning. The aim of the workshop is to provide insight into the latest research advances in the area. In a period of two days, the workshop will host a number of invited speakers who will present research talks related to software reliability and correctness.

	<td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip="Probabilistic programming is the idea of writing models from statistics and machine learning using program notations and reasoning about these models using generic inference engines. Recently its combination with deep learning has been explored intensely, which led to the development of so called deep probabilistic programming languages, such as Pyro, Edward and ProbTorch. At the core of this development lie inference engines based on stochastic variational inference algorithms. When asked to find information about the posterior distribution of a model written in such a language, these algorithms convert this posterior-inference query into an optimisation problem and solve it approximately by a form of gradient ascent or descent. In this paper, we analyse one of the most fundamental and versatile variational inference algorithms, called score estimator or REINFORCE, using tools from denotational semantics and program analysis. We formally express what this algorithm does on models denoted by programs, and expose implicit assumptions made by the algorithm on the models. The violation of these assumptions may lead to an undefined optimisation objective or the loss of convergence guarantee of the optimisation process. We then describe rules for proving these assumptions, which can be automated by static program analyses. Some of our rules use nontrivial facts from continuous mathematics, and let us replace requirements about integrals in the assumptions, such as integrability of functions defined in terms of programs' denotations, by conditions involving differentiation or boundedness, which are much easier to prove automatically (and manually). Following our general methodology, we have developed a static program analysis for the Pyro programming language that aims at discharging the assumption about what we call model-guide support match. Our analysis is applied to the eight representative model-guide pairs from the Pyro webpage, which include sophisticated neural network models such as AIR. It finds a bug in two of these cases, and shows that the assumptions are met in the others. This is joint work with Wonyeol Lee and Hangyeol Yu (KAIST, South Korea) and Xavier Rival (INRIA Paris/CNRS/ENS/PSL Research University, France).">Towards Verified Stochastic Variational Inference for Probabilistic Programs</div></td>

Thus, even a programmer with a limited exposure to statistical machine learning can benefit from powerful probabilistic inference. In effect, the programmer only needs to write a high-level model in a programming language with support for random sampling and conditioning on data. The underlying probabilistic programming system (which executes the high-level probabilistic programs) hides the complexity of inference algorithms away from the program developer. While the research community has focused primarily on improving expressiveness of probabilistic languages and efficiency of inference algorithms, analyses of probabilistic programs and techniques for debugging probabilistic software will have a key role in improving programmer productivity in this emerging domain. In this talk, I will present our recent work on testing probabilistic programming systems and tools for analyzing robustness of probabilistic programs.">Analysis and Testing for Probabilistic Programming</div></td>

In this talk I will describe our experience building and using GraphicsFuzz, an automated testing tool for graphics drivers based on metamorphic testing. GraphicsFuzz originated as a research project at Imperial College London, which led to the GraphicsFuzz spin-out company that was acquired by Google in 2018. GraphicsFuzz is now a central line of defence in ensuring the quality of graphics drivers for the Android platform. GraphicsFuzz focuses on finding bugs in shader compilers. GraphicsFuzz automatically finds cases where a shader compiler has generated wrong code by: (1) starting with an original, high-value shader (e.g. captured from a game); (2) applying semantics-preserving transformations to this original shader to produce a family of equivalent shaders that should render identical or very similar images to the original shader when executed on the same GPU; (3) calling out compiler bugs by identifying significant mismatch between images; (4) homing in on the root causes of bugs by automatically reducing a transformed shader for which a mismatch occurs until the difference between the original and transformed shaders is as small as possible whilst still preserving the mismatch. As well as providing technical details of how the approach works and showcasing some example bugs found by the technique, I will discuss some of the main open problems and opportunities related to applying metamorphic testing automatically at scale, including how to cope with potential false alarms related to round-off error associated with floating-point computation, how to automatically triage and de-duplicate bug reports, and how to test the metamorphic testing tool itself.">GraphicsFuzz: Metamorphic Testing for Graphics Shader Compilers</div></td>

	<td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip="Producing reliable systems software is a major challenge, plagued by the ubiquitous problems of shared mutable state, pointer aliasing, dynamic memory management, and subtle concurrency issues such as race conditions; even expert programmers struggle to tame the wide variety of reasons why their programs may not behave as they intended. Formal verification offers potential solutions to many of these problems, but typically at a very high price: the mathematical techniques employed are highly-complex, and difficult for even expert researchers to understand and apply. The relatively-new Rust programming language is designed to help with the former problem: a powerful ownership type system requires programmers to specify and restrict their discipline for referencing heap locations, providing in return the strong guarantee* that code type-checked by this system will be free from dangling pointers, unexpected aliasing, race conditions and the like. While this rules out a number of common errors, the question of whether a program behaves as intended remains. In this talk, I’ll give an overview of the Prusti project, which leverages Rust’s type system and compiler analyses for formal verification. By combining the rich information available about a type-checked Rust program with separate user-specification of intended behaviour, Prusti enables a user to verify functional correctness of their code without interacting with a complex program logic; in particular, specifications and all interactions with our implemented tool are at the level of abstraction of Rust expressions.

To accomplish these objectives, we propose a performance model that captures series-parallel relationships between various dynamic execution fragments of tasks and includes fine-grained measurement of computation in those fragments. Using this performance model, our what-if analyses mimic the effect of parallelization and identify regions that improve the parallelism of the program while considering the cost of parallel execution.

How can we make sure that these algorithms do not leak our private data? How do we make sure they are fair? Over the past few years, we have been exploring this question through the lens of automated verification and synthesis. In this talk, I will discuss automated techniques for proving the correctness of randomized algorithms and apply them to differentially private mechanisms, which have seen numerous applications in privacy-preserving data analysis as well as ensuring forms of fairness in decision-making. Technically, I will demonstrate how powerful SMT solvers, which revolutionized automated verification of traditional programs, can be applied to reasoning about randomized algorithms.">Privacy and Automated Verification</div></td>

	<td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip="Virtually all real-valued computations are carried out using floating-point data types and operations. With the current emphasis of system development often being on computational efficiency, developers as well as compilers are increasingly attempting to optimize floating-point routines. Reasoning about the correctness of these optimizations is complicated, and requires error analysis procedures with different characteristics and trade-offs. In my talk, I will motivate the need for such analyses. Then, I will present both a dynamic and a rigorous static analysis we developed for estimating errors of floating-point routines. Finally, I will describe how we extended our rigorous static analysis into a procedure for mixed-precision tuning of floating-point routines.">Analysis and Synthesis of Floating-Point Routines</div></td>

To describe and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types rooted in linear logic. To control resource usage, it uses resource-aware session types and automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA), a type-based technique for inferring resource bounds. To track linear assets, Nomos employs a linear type system that prevents assets from being duplicated or discarded. The talk reviews AARA and session types, highlights the main design choices, and illustrates the concepts with example contracts.">Resource-Aware Session Types for Programming Digital Contracts</div></td>
