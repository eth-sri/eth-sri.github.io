<h2>Workshop Information</h2>
Ensuring that our programs behave securely and reliably is a fundamental challenge facing computing today. Recent years have seen an explosion of a diverse set of new techniques for addressing this challenge ranging from verification and synthesis approaches to dynamic methods to quantitative reasoning to machine learning techniques. The aim of the workshop is to provide insight into the latest research advances in the area by hosting leading scientists who will present the latest and most advanced methods for addressing this fundamental challenge.

We discuss how our research team at Intel Labs, Machine Programming Research, is working toward new ways to automatically develop software based on two key tenets: (i) improving software developer productivity and (ii) improving software quality (e.g., correctness, performance, security, etc.). We discuss MP across three pillars: intention, invention, and adaptation. We also discuss the criticality of data for dependable and secure MP systems, which we believe is foundational to all MP systems. We close with some recent MP systems that we have built that have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in code semantics similarity, security debugging, and optimization."> Machine Programming & Data-Driven Dependable and Secure Software Systems</div></td>

	<td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip="Low-level pointer-manipulating programs form the backbone of our digital infrastructure. Unfortunately, they are susceptible to memory safety bugs, such as buffer overflows and use-after-free, which lead to crashes and security vulnerabilities. A promising approach to eliminating memory safety bugs is to use program synthesis technology to generate provably safe low-level code automatically from high-level specifications. In this talk I will present a program synthesizer SuSLik, which accepts a logical specification as input, and produces a provably safe C program as output. SuSLik is the first synthesizer capable of generating a wide range of operations on linked data structures (such as singly- and doubly-linked lists, sorted lists, and trees) without additional hints from the user. To make this possible, SuSLik relies on a novel proof system—synthetic separation logic—to derive correct-by-construction programs directly from their specifications."> Synthesis of Safe Pointer-Manipulating Programs</div></td>

Previously, he was an ARC DECRA Fellow and a Senior Lecturer at Monash University in Australia and PostDoc at the CISPA Helmholtz Zentrum. Marcel received his PhD from the National University of Singapore. His current research interest is the automatic discovery of software bugs and security flaws at the very large scale. One part of his group develops the foundations of automatic software testing to elucidate fundamental limitations of existing techniques, and to explore the assurances that software testing provides when no bugs are found. The other part of his group develops practical vulnerability discovery tools that are publicly available and widely used in software security practice. Marcel is leading his group with an explicit reproducibility policy.">Marcel Böhme</div></a></td>

	<td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip="Fuzzing has become a tremendous success story for automated bug finding. For instance, Google has been fuzzing the 500 most popular open source projects on 100k+ machines 24/7. The average open-source project receives bug reports at a constant rate of three to four new bugs per week - many of which are security critical. So, what makes fuzzing so efficient? Under which conditions does a simple random test input generation outperform symbolic execution even if we assume that the latter could prove the absence of bugs? Which kind of correctness guarantees does a fuzzing campaign provide that finds no bugs? And how many more bugs does an adversary find that has 10^x times more machines than I do?"> On the Surprising Efficiency and Exponential Cost of Fuzzing</div></td>
