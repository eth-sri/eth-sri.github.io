<h2>Workshop Information</h2>
    Ensuring that our programs behave securely and reliably is a fundamental challenge facing computing today. Recent years have seen an explosion of a diverse set of new techniques for addressing this challenge ranging from verification and synthesis approaches to dynamic methods to quantitative reasoning to machine learning techniques. The aim of the workshop is to provide insight into the latest research advances in the area by hosting leading scientists who will present the latest and most advanced methods for addressing this fundamental challenge.

  <td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip="Program synthesis should deliver interpretable, formally correct executable code. These objectives are satisfied when the synthesized programs are small, and when those programs are specified in a formal logic. Classic program synthesis often makes such assumptions. But machine learning methods are now unlocking synthesis of longer, more complex programs, and doing so from imprecise specifications, such as natural language. In this talk, I will present steps toward maintaining the trustworthiness and interpretability of program synthesis when combined with learning methods. First, I will show that neural language models over source code can be made more trustworthy by training them to simultaneously generate programs and testcases. By having the neural language model "check its work", these autogenerated testcases allow the model to predict when it *can't* solve a problem, instead of outputting a buggy program. Second, the talk will discuss a system for automatically refactoring synthesized programs to expose common substructure. Refactoring to obtain this more modular representation causes the programs to (1) qualitatively, be more interpretable, and (2) quantitatively, to be shorter.

<td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip=" Program synthesis is the problem of generating a program to satisfy a specification of user intent. Since these specifications are usually partial, this means searching a space of candidate programs for one that exhibits the desired behavior. A lion’s share of the work on program synthesis focuses on new ways to perform the search, but allowing the user to communicate intent remains a major challenge. This talk focuses on the complex relationship between user intent, specifications, and interaction model. In the domain of program synthesis, we narrow our focus by targeting a more specific category of users. Focusing on any subgroup of users allows making assumptions on both the input the user can generate for the synthesizer and the output they can consume. In the case of developers, concepts that are part of the programmer’s life such as code review and read-eval-print loops (REPL) can be leveraged for interactions with a synthesizer. The talk describes two synthesis-based tools that both leverage and cater to programmers as their users and examines the intersection of intent, specification, and interaction model. 
Synthesizer design shows us how these elements can be at odds with each other, in particular the tension between the interface and state of the art synthesis techniques. Synthesis is, at best, a computationally hard problem, and many existing program synthesis tools and techniques were designed around the synthesizer and its internals, their user interface dictated by the needs of the synthesizer. We demonstrate the process of concurrently building both the synthesizer and its intended user-facing tool as a way to search for a balance of the needs of the interaction model (and, implicitly, the user) and the algorithm, and as a bonus discover how it is beneficial to sometimes make the user work for the tool, rather than the other way around."> Program Synthesis Co-Design </div></td>

Its users include Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, PlayStation, Qualcomm, and many others. We started verifying LLVM almost a decade ago. In the process, we found bugs everywhere: in LLVM, in SMT solvers, in the documentation, and in our own tools. We also found shortcomings in the compilers’ theoretical models, namely of undefined behavior, memory, and concurrency. For example, we showed that it was impossible to run certain classic textbook optimizations together in LLVM. This led us to make fundamental architectural changes in LLVM itself. Moreover, LLVM kept changing every single day. We caught many regressions along the way. 
In this talk, we will cover our attempts to verify LLVM. The tools we built, the bugs we caught, the bugs we missed, the good and the bad surprises, and our contributions to theoretical models of compilers. We will also discuss why and how our automatic formal verification tools are used by compiler engineers on a daily basis.

Software systems are increasingly more complex and consist of deep stacks. Software’s soaring complexity combined with the end of Moore's Law is causing a shift to a more heterogeneous hardware landscape, comprising CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, fast networks, and denser memory technologies. For the foreseeable future, improving the efficiency of computer systems will be crucial to enable society’s growing reliance on feature-rich software. Alas, trustworthiness in this complex ecosystem is often an afterthought. Consequently, software and hardware have been plagued with bugs that cause data loss, security vulnerabilities, and failures of critical infrastructure. Building systems that are simultaneously efficient (i.e., deliver high performance at scale, leverage heterogeneous resources) and trustworthy (i.e., contain fewer bugs, achieve greater security) is extremely challenging. In this talk, I will give an overview of the research of my group that focuses on developing systems that are simultaneously efficient and trustworthy, with a focus on real-world technical and societal impact."> The Quest for Efficient and Trustworthy Systems</div></td>

	<td><div class="talk" style="color: #0079AF;" data-tooltip="Information flow security ensures that the secret data manipulated by a program does not influence its observable output. Proving information flow security is especially challenging for concurrent programs, where operations on secret data may influence the execution time of a thread and, thereby, the interleaving between different threads. Such internal timing channels may affect the observable outcome of a program even if an attacker does not observe execution times. Existing verification techniques for information flow security in concurrent programs attempt to prove that secret data does not influence the relative timing of threads. However, these techniques are often restrictive (for instance because they disallow branching on secret data) and make unrealistically strong assumptions about the execution platform (ignoring caching, processor instructions with data-dependent runtime, and other common features that affect execution time).
In this talk, we will present a novel verification technique for secure information flow in concurrent programs that lifts these restrictions and does not make any assumptions about timing behavior. The key idea is to prove that all mutating operations performed on shared data commute, such that different thread interleavings do not influence its final value. Crucially, commutativity is required only for an abstraction of the shared data that contains the information that will be leaked to a public output. Abstract commutativity is satisfied by many more operations than standard commutativity, which makes our technique widely applicable.
We will describe the formalization of our technique in CommCSL, a relational concurrent separation logic with support for commutativity-based reasoning, and its implementation in HyperViper, an automated verifier based on the Viper verification infrastructure, and demonstrate its ability to verify challenging examples."> CommCSL: Proving Information Flow Security for Concurrent Programs using Abstract Commutativity</div></td>
