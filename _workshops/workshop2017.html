<h2>Workshop Information</h2>
Ensuring that our programs behave correctly and reliably is a fundamental challenge facing computing today. Recent years have seen an explosion of a diverse set of new techniques for ensuring program correctness ranging from verification and synthesis approaches to runtime systems to quantitative reasoning. The aim of the workshop is to provide insight into the latest research advances in the area. In a period of two days, the workshop will host a number of invited speakers who will present research talks related to software reliability and correctness.

The language provides domain-specific constructs for describing the input-output formats and functionality of packet-processing pipelines. Unfortunately P4 programs can go wrong in a variety of interesting and frustrating ways including reading uninitialized data, generating malformed packets, and failing to handle exceptions. In this talk, I will present the design and implementation of p4v, a tool for verifying P4 programs. The tool is based on classic software verification techniques (due to Hoare, Dijkstra, Flanagan, Leino, etc.), but adds several important innovations: a novel mechanism for incorporating control-plane assumptions and domain-specific optimizations, both of which are needed to scale up to large programs. I will discuss our experiences applying p4v to a variety of real-world programs including switch.p4, a large program that implements the functionality of a conventional switch.

Accordingly, a lot of effort has been invested in verifying such protocols. However, due to the infinite state space (e.g., unbounded number of nodes, messages) and protocols complexity, verification is both undecidable and hard in practice. This talk will describe an interactive approach for formal verification of distributed protocols. The idea is to model systems and their properties in a decidable fragment of first-order logic, and use inductive invariants to prove correctness. To infer inductive invariants, we interact with a user based on graphically displayed counterexamples. These techniques are applied to verify safety of several variants of Paxos. The approach is implemented in the IVy system, and already resulted in the first mechanized proofs for some variants of Paxos.">Interactive Verification of Distributed Protocols</div></td>

A major challenge to building an application that leverages these mechanisms, however, is to verify that the implementation satisfies the basic invariants that these mechanisms require -- given a model of how faults may manifest during the application's execution.

	In this talk, I will present Leto, a verification system that enables developers to verify their applications with respect to a first-class execution model specification.

Unfortunately, none of Rust's safety claims have been formally proven, and there is good reason to question whether they actually hold. Specifically, Rust employs a strong, ownership-based type system, but then extends the expressive power of this core type system through libraries that internally use unsafe features. In this work, we present RustBelt, the first formal (and machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a realistic subset of Rust.  Our proof is extensible in the sense that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can say what verification condition it must satisfy in order for it to be deemed a safe extension to the language. We have carried out this verification for some of the most important libraries that are used throughout the Rust ecosystem.  In the talk, I will first review some of the essential features of Rust, and then explain some of the key ideas behind the RustBelt verification.">RustBelt: Securing the Foundations of the Rust Programming Language</div></td>

	Our technique uses a new form of product program, which reduces secure information flow to a traditional safety property. In contrast to earlier work, our product programs do not duplicate method calls. This allows us to employ procedure contracts that specify information flow properties and, thus, to reason about procedures modularly. We will present our product programs and discuss how to extend the approach to several advanced information flow properties.">Modular Verification of Secure Information Flow</div></td>

	<td><div class="talk" data-tooltip="We consider the following basic task in the testing of concurrent systems. The input to the task is a partial order of events, which models actions performed on or by the system and specifies ordering constraints between them. The task is to determine if some scheduling of these events can result in a bug. The number of schedules to be explored can, in general, be exponential.

	Empirically, many bugs in concurrent programs have been observed to have small bug depth; that is, these bugs are exposed by every schedule that orders some d specific events in a particular way, irrespective of how the other events are ordered, and d is small compared to the total number of events.

	To find all bugs of depth d, one needs to only test a d-hitting family of schedules: we call a set of schedules a d-hitting family if for each set of d events, and for each allowed ordering of these events, there is some schedule in the family that executes these events in this ordering. The size of a d-hitting family may be much smaller than the number of all possible schedules.

	While in general, finding the size of optimal d-hitting families is hard, even for d=2, we show that when the partial order is a tree, one can explicitly construct d-hitting families of schedules of small size. We conclude by describing a number of related tasks and combinatorial constructions that provide rigorous guarantees on the size of test sets for concurrent programs.

Users of such a system must write full specifications of the tasks that they want performed. The designer of the system is expected to define the domain that the system will handle, and specify the domain-dependent heuristics that guide automated reasoning.

	The assumption of specifications reflects a common expectation in formal methods research: that humans hold deep knowledge about problem domains and instances. In practice, this expectation can be violated and lead to hard-to-use or brittle tools. In this talk, we describe an approach to formal methods that addresses this difficulty through automatic discovery of knowledge from corpora of pre-existing code, execution traces, and proofs.

	Our thesis is that many of the specifications and heuristics relevant to a programming task are broadly shared with other tasks. Such insights can be algorithmically learned from datasets of existing formal artifacts, and can lead to systems for program analysis and synthesis that demand less human intervention than traditional tools. The talk will describe two concrete instantiations of this thesis, in the form of a  statistical approach to finding errors in the way a program uses APIs, and a statistical approach to program synthesis.">Guiding Formal Methods with Discovered Knowledge</div></td>

Implementing state machine replication is notoriously difficult due to asynchronous communication and the occurrence of faults, such as the network dropping messages or processes crashing.

	One fundamental obstacle in having correct fault-tolerant implementations is the lack of abstractions when reasoning about their behaviors. In this talk we focus on partially synchronous programming abstractions that view asynchronous faulty systems as synchronous ones with an adversarial environment that simulates asynchrony and faults by dropping messages. This view simplifies the proof arguments making systems amendable to automated verification.

	Technically, we take a programming language perspective and define a domain specific language which has a partially synchronous semantics and separates the implementation of network constraints from the algorithmic computation done by processes. We validate our technique by defining partially synchronous abstractions for several state machine replication algorithms, enabling automation of the verification procedure.">Partially synchronous programming abstractions for replicated state machine</div></td>

Unfortunately debugging informations themselves can be pervaded by subtle bugs.  Linus Torvalds wrote around 2012:

  'The whole (and only) point of unwinders is to make debugging easy when a bug occurs. But the *** DWARF unwinder had bugs itself, or our DWARF information had bugs, and in either case it actually turned several trivia bugs into a total undebuggable hell...If you can mathematically prove that the unwinder is correct -- even in the presence of bogus and actively incorrect unwinding information -- and never ever follows a bad pointer, I'll reconsider.'
