<h2>Workshop Information</h2>
Ensuring that our programs behave correctly and reliably is a fundamental challenge facing computing today. Recent years have seen an explosion of a diverse set of new techniques for ensuring program correctness ranging from verification and synthesis approaches to runtime systems to quantitative reasoning. The aim of the workshop is to provide insight into the latest research advances in the area. In a period of two days, the workshop will host a number of invited speakers who will present research talks related to software reliability and correctness.

They are widely used in government, scientific, and financial settings; over 95% of US firms use spreadsheets for financial reporting and 85% use them for budgeting and forecasting. At the same time, spreadsheet user interfaces make it easy for users to accidentally introduce both data and formula errors (e.g., by dragging or making copy and paste errors) -- a recent manual audit of a number of spreadsheets found an error rate of over 95%. These errors have had catastrophic consequences, leading to losses of billions of dollars.

	Despite their prevalence and significance, the PL community has largely ignored spreadsheets and there are thus few tools to help debug them. This phenomenon is likely due to the fact that spreadsheet errors are not clear-cut: it is generally not possible to distinguish correct from incorrect spreadsheets, beyond egregious errors like malformed formula syntax or divide-by-zero errors. In this talk, I will discuss these challenges and present work from my group on principled approaches for effectively identifying problems both in spreadsheet data and code.">On the Correctness of Spreadsheets: An Excellent Problem for Programming Language Researchers</div></td>

The key insight is toexploit the close interplay between (1) dynamically executing a exploit the close interplay between (1) dynamically executing a program on some test input and (2) statically compiling the program to work on all possible input. Indeed, the test input induces a natural collection of the original program's EMI variants, which help test any compiler and specifically target the difficult-to-find miscompilations.

	We have developed a series of gradually sophisticated techniques to generate EMI variants by (1) profiling a program's test executions, and (2) stochastically deleting/inserting/mutating code. Our extensive testing to date has led to 1000+ confirmed bug reports for GCC and LLVM alone, of which 600+ have already been fixed. The EMI concept is widely applicable --- beyond testing compilers, it can be adapted to validate program transformations and analyses, and software in general.">EMI Testing: Finding 1000+ Bugs in GCC and LLVM in 3 Years</div></td>

	<td><div class="talk" data-tooltip="In dynamically typed programming languages, type errors can occur at runtime. Executing the test suites that often accompany programs may provide some confidence about absence of such errors, but generally without any guarantee. We present a program analysis that can check whether a test suite has sufficient coverage to prove a given type-related property, which is particularly challenging for program code with overloading and value dependent types. The analysis achieves a synergy between scalable static analysis and dynamic analysis that goes beyond what can be accomplished by the static analysis alone. Additionally, the analysis provides a new coverage adequacy metric for the completeness of a test suite regarding a family of type-related properties.

	Based on an implementation for Dart, we demonstrate how such a hybrid static/dynamic program analysis can be used for measuring the quality of a test suite with respect to showing absence of type errors and inferring sound call graph information, specifically for program code that is difficult to handle by traditional static analysis techniques.">Analyzing Test Completeness for Dynamic Languages</div></td>

While safety verification is undecidable for most realistic programming models, there are many automated techniques that perform well in practice. In this talk, I will present SeaHorn -- a software verification framework for C programs. A distinguishing feature of SeaHorn is a modular design that decouples the concerns of the syntax of the programming language, from its operational and verification semantics. While operational and verification semantics should coincide, this is extremely difficult to achieve in an effective way in practice. SeaHorn builds on several advances in software verification: (a) it contributes an efficient yet precise inter-procedural SMT-based verification algorithm, (b) it provides flexible verification semantics with support for different levels of precision and abstraction, (c) it successfully combines software model checking and abstract interpretation, and (d) it uses the logic of Constrained Horn Clauses as its intermediate verification language.

	SeaHorn provides the users of verification with a powerful automated verification tool, while being an extensible and customizable framework for experimenting with and developing new software verification techniques. ">Algorithmic Logic-Based Verification with SeaHorn</div></td>

	Flow's overall goal is to maximize developer productivity without cramping the ``flow'' of normal JavaScript development. On the one hand, Flow uses advanced static analysis techniques to understand common JavaScript idioms precisely. This helps it find non-trivial bugs in code and provide code intelligence to editors without requiring significant rewriting or annotations from the developer. On the other hand, Flow uses aggressive parallelization and incrementalization to deliver near-instantaneous response times.

	This static analysis problem is especially challenging because of the need to reason about the effects of inter-component callback inter-leavings. We address this problem by developing a goal-directed abstract interpretation approach that can selectively abstract the event control-flow to realize an analysis that jumps between relevant callbacks.

	Another challenge to analyzing event-driven software frameworks like Android is that the set of possible callbacks that may be invoked by the framework is not static for all applications but can be dynamically updated by the app through its interaction with the framework. To address this issue, we formalize a model of event-driven frameworks and investigate specification mining techniques from large number of execution traces of apps interacting with the Android framework.">Analyzing, Abstracting, and Mining Event-Driven Systems</div></td>

<ul>
	<li> Tram no. 6 (direction Zoo) from tram stop "Bahnhofstrasse/HB", exit at tram stop "ETH/Universit&aumltsspital" (right next to the ETH main building). Journey time: about 8 minutes or </li>
	<li> Tram no. 10 (direction Flughafen or Bahnhof Oerlikon) from tram stop "Bahnhofplatz/HB", exit at tram stop "ETH/Universit&aumltsspital". Journey time: about 8 minutes </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
From <a href="http://www.flughafen-zuerich.ch/"><strong>Z&uumlrich airport</strong></a>: You can either take the tram to ETH or a train to the city center (Z&uumlrich HB):
<ul>
	<li> Tram no. 10 (direction Bahnhofplatz/HB) to tram stop "ETH/Universittsspital". The tram operates daily from 6 a.m to 11 p.m. with trams departing every 7 to 15 minutes. Journey time: 30 minutes </li>
	<li> S-Bahn/Train: Follow the signs "Bahn/Railway" to the ticket counters and/or ticket machines. You will find instructions in English on the ticket machines. Get a ticket for "Z&uumlrich City" (make sure that the display shows "1 Std"). The machines accept coins as well as bills and gives change (the ticket costs 6.40 CHF). The ticket is valid for 1 hour for all trains to Z&uumlrich as well as for trams and buses in the city (streetcar, Strassenbahn). Take the escalator down to the platforms. Trains to the city center leave approx. every 10 minutes and it takes about 10 minutes to reach the main station.</li>
