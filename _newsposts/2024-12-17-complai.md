[]() Together with our spin-off [LatticeFlow](https://latticeflow.ai/) and [INSAIT](https://insait.ai/), we launched [COMPL-AI](https://compl-ai.org/), an open-source compliance-centered evaluation framework for Generative AI models. The release was covered by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/latticeflows-llm-framework-takes-a-first-stab-at-benchmarking-big-ais-compliance-with-eu-ai-act/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/eu-ai-act-checker-reveals-big-techs-compliance-pitfalls-2024-10-16/), and [EuroNews](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/16/are-ai-companies-complying-with-the-eu-ai-act-a-new-llm-checker-can-find-out).
