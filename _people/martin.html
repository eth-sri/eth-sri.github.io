<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Welcome to my page. My name is Martin and I am originally from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia">Sofia, Bulgaria</a> where I was born and grew up.</br>
    Currently, I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> where I lead the <a href="{{ "/" | relative_url }}">Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab</a>.</br>
    Prior to ETH, I was a Research Staff Member at the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/index.shtml">IBM T.J. Watson Research Center</a> in New York, USA (2007 - 2011).</br>
    I obtained my PhD from the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, England (2003-2008).</br>
    I obtained my B.Sc. from <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University (SFU) </a>, Canada (1996-2001).</br>
    Before that I studied at the <a href="http://wikimapia.org/1526790/Sofia-High-School-of-Mathematics">Sofia High School of Mathematics (SMG) </a>.</p>

    <p>My work spans the intersection of artificial intelligence and programming languages, including both theoretical and system aspects. I have given a number of invited and keynote talks on these topics at various conferences and workshops (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59ujp8-Ijw4" target=_blank><img class="pdf-load" src="{{"/assets/images/youtube.png" | relative_url }}"></a>). With my group we have also built a number of AI systems, now widely used in academia and industry. I have also co-founded two start-ups: <a href="http://deepcode.ai">DeepCode</a> which aims to revolutionize programming using AI, and <a href="http://chainsecurity.com">ChainSecurity</a>, which brings security to decentralized systems using advanced automated reasoning.</p>

    <p>My research has received numerous awards and recognitions including the <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Milner/">ACM SIGPLAN Robin Milner Young Researcher Award</a> for major contributions to the area of programming languages, Distinguished Paper Awards (RV, OOPSLA), SIGPLAN Research Highlight, CACM Research Highlight, ERC Starting Grant, Google and Facebook Faculty Research Awards, Outstanding Artifact Award (OOPSLA), IBM Research Division Award, IBM Extraordinary Accomplishment Award (awarded by John Kelly, IBM Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research), IBM Research Outstanding Project Award, John Atanasoff Award, awarded by the President of Bulgaria (<a href="{{"assets/images/jav1.jpg" | relative_url }}">Photo</a>, National TV: <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp7RZPPYXZ4 target=_blank><img class="pdf-load" src="{{"/assets/images/youtube.png" | relative_url }}"></a>), IBM Invention and Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards, University Scholarships (SFU, Cambridge), and others.</p>

    <p>I was the Program Chair for <a href="http://conf.researchr.org/track/pldi-2017/pldi-2017-papers">ACM PLDI'17</a>, a top conference in programming languages and systems. I currently serve on the SIGPLAN steering committee, SIGPLAN research highlights committee and the SIGPLAN Doctoral Dissertaion Award committee.</p>

    <p>I have also spoken on topics related to artificial intelligence and security as well as ERC grants and science at the European Parliament: <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlgS1kfRko8 target=_blank><img class="pdf-load" src="{{"/assets/images/youtube.png" | relative_url }}"></a>
