<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
Since July 2024, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the <a href="{{ "/" | relative_url }}">Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/">ETH Zürich</a>, advised by <a href="{{ "/people/martin" | relative_url }}">Prof. Martin Vechev</a>. My research focuses on enhancing the reliability and security of Large Language Models, with an emphasis on ensuring the faithfulness and correctness of generated text and code.

Previously, I worked on the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-17715-6_21">formal verification of data structures and algorithms</a> and co-founded a start-up specializing in Smart Contracts.
 </p>

 <p>
  If you are interested in conducting a research project, BSc Thesis or MSc Thesis at SRI, I am looking for motivated students with a strong background in programming languages and formal methods. Feel free to contact me about this via e-mail. I am open to new project ideas. Some suggestions around formal methods for Large Language Models include:
  <ul>
    <li>Extending <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/muendler2025typeawareconstraint.md %}">Type-Constrained Code Generation</a> (Go, Java, etc.)</li>
    <li>Improving the efficiency of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/muendler2025constraineddiffusion.md %}">Constrained Decoding for Diffusion LLMs</a></li>
  </ul>
 </p>

I believe most are unaware of what they do obviously wrong, so please roast me anonymously via <a href="https://www.admonymous.co/nielstron">admonymous</a>.
