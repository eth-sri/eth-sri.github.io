<h2>About me</h2>

My research revolves around the reliability and security of Large Language Models, focusing on faithfulness and correctness of generated text and code. Previously I worked on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-17715-6_21">formal verification of data structures and algorithms</a>, and co-founded a Start-Up in the field of Smart Contracts.
