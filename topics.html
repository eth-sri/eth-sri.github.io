		We maintain a detailed up-to-date list of B.Sc. and M.Sc. thesis topics -- if you are interested, please contact <a href="mailto:martin.vechev@inf.ethz.ch">Prof. Martin Vechev</a>.
		<br><br>
		To get an idea of the kind of work going on in our group, check out <a href="{{ "/research" | relative_url }}">Research Projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/publications" | relative_url }}">Publications</a> to get a flavor for the kind of work that we do. Under each of these topics, there is a wide range of possible B.Sc. and M.Sc. theses available -- from pure software engineering/system building to theoretical investigations. A number of prior theses done in the group have won a medal for best thesis at ETH and have appeared as publications in top venues in various fields of computer science including programming languages, security, and machine learning (e.g., CCS, PLDI, ICML, NIPS, etc).
