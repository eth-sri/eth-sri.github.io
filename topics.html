		Do you want to conduct research at the intersection of theory and practice and build state-of-the-art systems? Our lab offers interesting Master thesis projects in a number of active areas of research:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="{{ "/research/safeai" | relative_url }}">Safe and interpretable artificial intelligence</a></li>
			<li><a href="{{ "/research/plml" | relative_url }}">Machine learning for programming</a></li>
			<li><a href="{{ "/research/blockchain-security" | relative_url }}">Blockchain security</a></li>
			<li><a href="{{ "/research/programmable-networks" | relative_url }}">Programmable networks</a></li>
			<li><a href="{{ "/research/quantum" | relative_url }}">Quantum programming</a></li>
		</ul>
		Many of the Master theses have been been published at top academic conferences in the areas of programming languages, security, and machine learning (e.g., CCS, PLDI, ICML, NeurIPS).
		<br><br>
		We encourage students towards real-world impact. Many of the systems built in our lab are released as open-source projects which are widely used in industry and academia. See our <a href="https://github.com/eth-sri">GitHub page</a> for details.
