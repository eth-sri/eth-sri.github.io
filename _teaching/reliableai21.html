<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Creating reliable and explainable probabilistic models is a fundamental challenge to solving the artificial intelligence problem. This course covers some of the latest and most exciting advances that bring us closer to constructing such models.

The main objective of this course is to expose students to the latest and most exciting research in the area of explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence, a topic of fundamental and increasing importance. Upon completion of the course, the students should have mastered the underlying methods and be able to apply them to a variety of problems.

To facilitate deeper understanding, an important part of the course will be a group hands-on programming project where students will build a system based on the learned material.
</p>

<p>The course covers some of the latest research (over the last 2-3 years) underlying the creation of safe, trustworthy, and reliable AI:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning (noise-based, geometry attacks, sound attacks, physical attacks, autonomous driving, out-ofppt-distribution)</li>
<li>Defenses against attacks</li>
<li>Combining gradient-based optimization with logic for encoding background knowledge</li>
<li>Complete Certification of deep neural networks via automated reasoning (e.g., via numerical abstractions, mixed-integer solvers)</li>
<li>Probabilistic certification of deep neural networks</li>
<li>Training deep neural networks to be provably robust via automated reasoning</li>
<li>Understanding and Interpreting Deep Networks</li>
<li>Probabilistic Programming</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Project introduction</strong></p>

The project will be presented on November 3.

<p><strong>Lectures</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The first lecture (September 22) will take place in HG G 3
	(physical).</li>
	<li>All remaining lectures will be pre-recorded and uploaded to a YouTube
	playlist (the private link can be obtained <a
	href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=83826">here</a>),
	typically by Tuesday evening. We recommend to watch the lectures during
	normal lecture hours (Wednesday 14-16)</li>
	<li>
		Every Wednesday at 3.40pm, there will be a virtual Q&A with Prof. Martin
		Vechev, on the topics of that week's lecture (<a
		href="https://ethz.zoom.us/j/69039534400">Zoom link to join</a>, you
		must be logged in with a *.ethz.ch account which you can create <a
		href="https://ethz.zoom.us/signup">here</a>).
	</li>
	<li>
		For additional questions, we have prepared a <a
		href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=15505">Moodle
		forum</a>.
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The first exercise sessions (September 27 and September 29) will be a
		general introduction to some prerequisites for the course, and will not
		involve an exercise sheet. The covered material should be familiar to
		most students, and the slides discussed in the session will be available
		online.
	</li>
	<li>Every week, we will publish an exercise sheet and its solutions <a
	href="https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/riai2021">here</a>, by Thursday
	evening.</li>
	<li>We strongly recommend to solve the exercises before next week's exercise
	session, and before looking at the solutions. The style of the exam will be
	similar to the exercises, so first-hand experience solving exercises is
	critical.</li>
	<li>The exercise sessions will be in a Q&A format, where you can ask
	questions about the exercise sheet (and its solutions) from the previous
	week. We will not cover additional material in the exercise sessions.
	Attending the exercise sessions is optional.</li>
	<li>For additional questions, we have prepared a <a
	href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=15505">Moodle
	forum</a>.</li>
	<li>In case there are not enough questions for the full exercise session, we
	will stop it early.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>

<p>
All communication (like special announcements) will be sent out by e-mail.
</p>
