<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This seminar is an opportunity to become familiar with current research in software engineering and more generally with the methods and challenges of scientific research.</p>

<p>Each student will be asked to study some papers from the recent software engineering literature and review them. 
Please refer to the schedule of <a href="https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/ses2025">one of the last years</a> for example topics.
  This is an exercise in critical review and analysis. Active participation is required (a presentation of a paper as well as participation in discussions).
</p>

<p>The aim of this seminar is to introduce students to recent research results in the area of programming languages and software engineering. To accomplish that, students will study and present research papers in the area as well as participate in paper discussions. The papers will span topics in both theory and practice, including papers on program verification, program analysis, testing, programming language design, and development tools.</p>
