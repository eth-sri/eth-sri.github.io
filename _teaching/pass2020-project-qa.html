<ul>

<li>
	The Datalog template (analyze.dl) declares the input facts "structLoad" and "structStore". Do we need to use these?

	<br>
	<em>Answer:</em> No. You can ignore structLoad and structStore as you do not need to support structuers.
	<br><br>
</li>


<li>
	The project description states that we must support the message variables such as msg.sender and msg.value. What other message variables should we support?

	<br>
	<em>Answer:</em> You need to support only msg.sender and msg.value.
	<br><br>
</li>


<li>
	A store input facts is given by "S10 V00 S09", where S09 is stored into V00. What is assigned to variable S10?

	<br>
	<em>Answer:</em> Nothing is stored at S10 because it is a store statement.
	<br><br>
</li>

<li>
    Do we need to model the precise semantics of expressions (e.g., arithmetics)?
    <br>
    <em>Answer:</em> No. You only need to track explicit data flow along computations. The additional examplese 8-10 in the project description illustrate this point.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Do we need to consider non-reachable code?
    <br>
    <em>Answer:</em> No, we will not have test cases with non-reachable code.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Do we need to go back to previous statements after we identify a guard?
    <br>
    <em>Answer:</em> Yes. After you identify a guard, you clear the taint tag of function arguments and message values, and re-analyze previous statements. We add example 11 in the project description to illustrate this point.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Suppose we have the following if-else branch "if (cond) {...} else {...}", where "cond" is a guard. Which branch is guarded?
    <br>
    <em>Answer:</em> Both branches are guarded. For the true branch, the guard is "cond". For the false branch, the guard is "!cond". We add example 12 in the project description to illustrate this point
    <br><br>
