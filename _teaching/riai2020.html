<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Creating reliable and explainable probabilistic models is a fundamental challenge to solving the artificial intelligence problem. This course covers some of the latest and most exciting advances that bring us closer to constructing such models.

The main objective of this course is to expose students to the latest and most exciting research in the area of explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence, a topic of fundamental and increasing importance. Upon completion of the course, the students should have mastered the underlying methods and be able to apply them to a variety of problems.

To facilitate deeper understanding, an important part of the course will be a group hands-on programming project where students will build a system based on the learned material.
</p>

<p>The course covers some of the latest research (over the last 2-3 years) underlying the creation of safe, trustworthy, and reliable AI:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning (noise-based, geometry attacks, sound attacks, physical attacks, autonomous driving, out-of-distribution)</li>
<li>Defenses against attacks</li>
<li>Combining gradient-based optimization with logic for encoding background knowledge</li>
<li>Complete Certification of deep neural networks via automated reasoning (e.g., via numerical abstractions, mixed-integer solvers)</li>
<li>Probabilistic certification of deep neural networks</li>
<li>Training deep neural networks to be provably robust via automated reasoning</li>
<li>Understanding and Interpreting Deep Networks</li>
<li>Probabilistic Programming</li>
</ul>

<!--
To gain a deeper understanding of the material and be able to apply and extend the concepts, an important part of the course will be a group hands-on programming project where students will build a system based on the learned material.

While we do cover the latest material, the course should be self-contained and any necessary background will be introduced in the lectures or in exercise sessions (e.g., basics of deep learning) together with additional pointers if needed. -->
