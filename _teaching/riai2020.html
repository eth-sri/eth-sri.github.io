<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Creating reliable and explainable probabilistic models is a fundamental challenge to solving the artificial intelligence problem. This course covers some of the latest and most exciting advances that bring us closer to constructing such models.

The main objective of this course is to expose students to the latest and most exciting research in the area of explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence, a topic of fundamental and increasing importance. Upon completion of the course, the students should have mastered the underlying methods and be able to apply them to a variety of problems.

To facilitate deeper understanding, an important part of the course will be a group hands-on programming project where students will build a system based on the learned material.
</p>

<p>The course covers some of the latest research (over the last 2-3 years) underlying the creation of safe, trustworthy, and reliable AI:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning (noise-based, geometry attacks, sound attacks, physical attacks, autonomous driving, out-of-distribution)</li>
<li>Defenses against attacks</li>
<li>Combining gradient-based optimization with logic for encoding background knowledge</li>
<li>Complete Certification of deep neural networks via automated reasoning (e.g., via numerical abstractions, mixed-integer solvers)</li>
<li>Probabilistic certification of deep neural networks</li>
<li>Training deep neural networks to be provably robust via automated reasoning</li>
<li>Understanding and Interpreting Deep Networks</li>
<li>Probabilistic Programming</li>
</ul>

<!--
To gain a deeper understanding of the material and be able to apply and extend the concepts, an important part of the course will be a group hands-on programming project where students will build a system based on the learned material.

While we do cover the latest material, the course should be self-contained and any necessary background will be introduced in the lectures or in exercise sessions (e.g., basics of deep learning) together with additional pointers if needed. -->

<p>Details on the course project will be added here.</p>

<p><strong>Project introduction</strong></p>
We will present the project on October 28 at 2pm, in a live zoom session
(<a href="https://ethz.zoom.us/j/91074189546">link</a>).
Note that the zoom session is not the same as for the normal lecture Q&A!

<h2 id="previous-exams">Previous Exams</h2>

<p>
Previous exams are available in the <a href="https://exams.vis.ethz.ch/">exam
collection</a> of the student association (VIS).
</p>

<h2 id="course-organization">Course Organization (Tentative)</h2>

<p>
Some aspects of the course organization are new due to COVID-19.
</p>

<p><strong>Lectures</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The lectures will be pre-recorded and uploaded by Tuesday evening (<a
	href="https://www.polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/3BRLj15rWDeITml">link to all
	lectures on Polybox</a>, the password can be found on <a
	href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=54108">Moodle</a>).
	We recommend to watch the lectures during normal lecture hours (Wednesday
	14-16).</li>
	<li>Every Wednesday at 3.40pm, there will be a virtual Q&A with Prof. Martin
	Vechev, on the topics of that week's lecture (Zoom link <b>to be announced</b>,
	the password can be found on <a
	href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=54108">Moodle</a>).</li>
	<li>For additional questions, we have prepared a <a
	href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=13306">Moodle
	forum</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Every week, we will publish an exercise sheet <a
	href="https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/riai2020">here</a>, by Thursday
	evening. We recommend to solve this exercise sheet before next week's
	exercise session.</li>
	<li>All exercise solutions will be published <a
	href="https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/riai2020">here</a>.</li>
	<li>The exercise sessions (Monday 12-14 and Wednesday 12-14) will be in a
	physical Q&A format, where you can ask questions about the exercise sheet
	(and its solutions) from the previous week. Attending the exercise sessions
	is optional.</li>
	<li>For additional questions, we have prepared a <a
	href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=13306">Moodle
	forum</a>.</li>
	<li>We note that occupancy restrictions apply for the exercise sessions. We will try to resolve things pragmatically in case of congestion.</li>
	<li>The first exercises session (September 21 and September 23) will be a general introduction to some prerequisites for the course, and will not involve an exercise sheet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>

All communication (like special announcements) will be sent out by e-mail.
