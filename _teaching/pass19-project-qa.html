<ul>

<li>
Why does this contract fail to compile?
<xmp>
  function main() public payable {
      uint a = 0;
      for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          a = a + 1;
      }
      sink(a); // Safe
  }
</xmp>

<br>
<em>Answer:</em> This was due to a bug in the code template. It is fixed in the latest commit in the <a href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/ptsankov/pass2019-project">Gitlab repository</a> of the code template.
<br><br>
</li>


<li>
Is this function Safe or Tainted?
<xmp>
function test1() payable public {
  int256 tmp = 2;
  if (msg.value > 4) {
    tmp = 2;
  }
  sink(tmp);
}
</xmp>

<br>
<em>Answer:</em> This contract is Safe. Examples like this can be tricky to handle, especially if computations are involved (you are not expected to model arithmetic operations in the solution).

</li>



<li>
Is this function Safe or Tainted?
<xmp>
function test2() payable public {
  int256 tmp = 1;
  if (msg.value > 4) {
    tmp = tmp + 2;
  }
  if (tmp > 0) {
    sink(54);
  } else {
    sink(9);
  }
}
</xmp>

<br>
<em>Answer:</em> This contract is Safe, because the sink arguments are constants (do not depend on msg.sender and msg.value) and the execution of the sinks do not depend on msg.sender and msg.value.
