<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>
The main goal of this seminar is to introduce students to the latest research trends in the field of programming languages and systems, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Core automated program analysis and synthesis techniques (e.g., new algorithms, combinations with machine learning).</li>
		<li>Inter-disciplinary applications of these techniques to a variety of challenges in system reliability, security and performance (e.g., reasoning about networks).</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<p>The seminar is carried out as a set of presentations (2 each lecture) chosen from a set of available papers (available below). The grade is determined as a function of the presentation, handling questions and answers, and participation.
